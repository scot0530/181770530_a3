        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>We were founded in the late 1700s by Swedish explorers who were searching for what
          some believe to be just a fairy tale: The Legendary Golden Donut. Bards have been known
          to sing songs and fables about this mysterious yet delicious tale, however none were able
          to discover whether the tales were true. Emperor Warrior-King Joseph Scott, descendant of
          King Arthur and Genghis Khan decided to take action to discover the truth. He, and his
          loyal servants embarked on a legendary tale of myth to build Holy Donuts from The Golden Donut!</p>

        <h2>Beyond Dough</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to keeping all of our donuts free from artifical flavouring
          and ensure that they are sourced from sustainable sources from our many partners
          in countries such as Canada, The United States of America, Mexico, Belgium, Germany,
          The United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, and Mongolia! Together we work on making
          the donut world as sustainable as possible by not only reducing emissions to zero,
          but also by having a positive emissions impact through our donut tree planting charities.</p>
